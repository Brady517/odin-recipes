    <h3>How to Make Chicken Parmesan That's Never Soggy!</h3>
        <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while
        this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
        <p>In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I
        have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much
        sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that
        way, not with this method.</p>
